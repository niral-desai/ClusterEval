# ClusterEval
ClusterEval is a Github repository with code for clustering synthetic and real-world data using K-means and hierarchical methods, with external and internal validation. The two main tasks are clustering synthetic data and the world indicators dataset. The repository plots data points and generates scatter plots of the data colored by group. 

# Project 
The objective of project 1 is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and
real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques
Task 1
Data sets, “Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”, “Data5.csv”, “Data6.csv”,
“Data7.csv”, “Data8.csv” contain the data points and their respective class information.
For each of the datasets follow the below steps
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics
3. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
original class
4. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm
Task 2
The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together
2. Use Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups
4. Generate three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points
according to the group. Example: “Life expectancy vs GDP”, “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.
